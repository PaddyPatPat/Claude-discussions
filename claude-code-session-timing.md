# Claude Code Session Timing

## Session Limit Warning Appearing Early

If you're seeing the "Approaching 5-hour limit" message earlier than expected (e.g., only 3 hours into your session), there could be several explanations:

### Possible Causes

1. **Session timing discrepancy** - There might be a difference between how you're tracking time versus how Claude Code measures session duration. The system might count from a different starting point or include time differently than you expect.

2. **Previous session continuation** - It's possible that Claude Code is continuing from a previous session that didn't properly terminate, so the timer includes time from an earlier session.

3. **System behavior** - There could be technical reasons why the warning appears earlier than expected, such as conservative estimates or system load considerations.

### Getting More Information

Since the specific technical details of how Claude Code's session timing works internally may not be readily available, you can:

- Check the Claude Code documentation at https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code for more precise information about session management.

- If the behavior seems incorrect or you're consistently seeing timing discrepancies, reach out to Anthropic support at https://support.anthropic.com - they would be able to investigate whether there's a technical issue or clarify how the session timing actually works.
