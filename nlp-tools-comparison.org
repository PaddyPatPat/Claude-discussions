nlp = stanza.Pipeline('en', processors='tokenize,pos,lemma,depparse,ner')
doc = nlp(text)
#+END_SRC

*** Hugging Face

pipeline = pipeline("text-classification", model="distilbert-base-uncased")
result = pipeline(text)
#+END_SRC

*** NLTK (Manual Pipeline)
#+BEGIN_SRC python
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
tagged = pos_tag(tokens)
entities = ne_chunk(tagged)
#+END_SRC

*** scikit-learn (Custom Pipeline)
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
