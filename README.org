* Key Topics Covered

** Container Technologies

- Proxmox LXC containers (system containers)
- Podman containers (OCI application containers)
- Docker comparison
- Container orchestration options

** Design Considerations

- Resource efficiency vs isolation
- Security implications
- Open source principles
- Migration from Docker
- Compliance requirements

** Architecture Patterns

- One Podman container per LXC container
- Multiple Podman containers per LXC container
- Grouped services by function/security/tenant
- Trade-offs and decision frameworks

** High Availability

- Proxmox clustering
- Load balancing strategies
- Database replication
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes/Nomad)
- Monitoring and failover

* Common Questions Answered

** Why Podman over Docker?

See [[file:podman-vs-docker.org][Podman vs Docker]] - covers rootless design, no daemon, pod support, and open-source compliance.

** Should I use LXC or VM?

See [[file:lxc-vs-vm-for-containers.org][LXC vs VM Comparison]] - explains when each is appropriate.

** What's the difference between LXC and Podman containers?

See [[file:system-vs-application-containers.org][System vs Application Containers]] - fundamental architectural differences.

** Can I run Docker containers with Podman?

See [[file:podman-vs-docker.org][Migration Guide]] in Podman vs Docker - 80-90% compatibility with minimal changes.

** What are OCI-compliant containers?

See [[file:oci-standards.org][OCI Standards]] - explains standardization and interoperability.

** How do I achieve high availability?

See [[file:high-availability-setup.org][High Availability Setup]] - multi-host configurations and layered HA approach.
