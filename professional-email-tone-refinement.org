* Overview

This document explores the process of refining professional email communication, particularly when requesting information or clarification from clients. It demonstrates how to transform overly deferential communication into assertive yet collaborative messaging through iterative refinement.

The core challenge: How to maintain professionalism and preserve business relationships while advocating for fair treatment and clear terms.

* The Problem with Deferential Communication

** Characteristics of Overly Deferential Emails

Deferential communication in professional contexts can undermine your position:

- Apologetic language when requesting legitimate information
- Passive voice and uncertain phrasing
- Allowing others to define terms after work is complete
- Lack of clear expectations or timelines
- Positioning yourself as subordinate rather than as a professional partner

** Impact on Business Relationships

Being too deferential can:
- Signal that you accept unfavorable terms
- Invite clients to "walk all over you"
- Undervalue your professional expertise
- Create unclear expectations for ongoing relationships
- Make it harder to negotiate fair compensation

* Email Refinement Process: Case Study

** Initial Deferential Draft

The original email exhibited several problematic patterns:

Subject: (unclear)

Hi Nikki,

Here are my questions to help me clarify how to complete my invoice
for the Ipswich V8 Supercars.

1. When do I start charging for my travel/rig day from Auckland?
2. When do I finish charging for my derig/travel day back to Auckland?
[... additional numbered questions ...]

Also, when we discussed my rate before I left NZ I said that I would
do it for whatever I agreed to for 2024/25 Adelaide Tennis.

What rate do you want me to charge?

Cheers,
Patrick.

*** Problems with This Approach

- No clear subject line
- Frames questions as seeking help rather than requesting necessary information
- Uses "what rate do you want me to charge?" - giving client full control
- Lacks context about why clarification is needed
- No timeline or expectations set
- Doesn't acknowledge future work relationship

** First Revision: Professional and Assertive

Subject: Invoice Details Required - Ipswich V8 Supercars

Hi Nikki,

I'm preparing my invoice for the Ipswich V8 Supercars work and need
to clarify your payment terms to ensure accurate billing.

Rate Confirmation:
There appears to be a discrepancy in the rates we've discussed. In
December 2024, Brooke confirmed $75 AUD/hour for similar work (see
email excerpt below), but your August email mentioned $70 AUD/hour.
Please confirm which rate applies, as this was not clearly established
before commencement.

Billing Parameters:
To complete the invoice, I need clarification on your standard billing
practices:

- Travel days: Billing commencement/completion points from Auckland
- Work days: Whether billing starts/ends at accommodation or on-site
- Meal breaks: Included or excluded from billable hours
- Minimum call periods: Whether non-travel days over 5 hours are
  billed as 10-hour minimums
- Overtime increments: 15 or 30-minute blocks

I'll use the roster from the SCA production manual as the base for
hours as you specified, once these parameters are confirmed.

Given we have additional projects scheduled in the coming months,
establishing these terms clearly now will streamline future invoicing
processes.

I'll send the completed invoice within 24 hours of receiving this
information.

Best regards,
Patrick

*** Improvements in This Version

- Clear, professional subject line
- Opens with statement of purpose, not apology
- Identifies rate discrepancy as *their* oversight, not your confusion
- Uses bullet points for clarity
- Sets timeline expectations ("within 24 hours")
- References ongoing relationship as leverage
- Removes uncertain language

*** Remaining Issues

The phrase "streamline future invoicing processes" felt too corporate and formal for an ongoing collaborative relationship.

** Second Iteration: Balancing Professionalism with Friendliness

The challenge: How to maintain assertiveness while being more approachable and collaborative.

*** Specific Language Changes

information.

* Key Principles for Professional Email Tone

** The Professional-Collaborative Balance

The goal is to position yourself as:
- A professional equal (not subordinate)
- A collaborative partner (not adversary)
- Someone with clear standards (not desperate for work)
- Friendly and approachable (not cold or corporate)

** Language Strategies

*** Avoid Apologetic Language

Don't say:
- "I'm sorry to bother you, but..."
- "I hope this isn't too much trouble..."
- "I'm not sure about..."

Instead:
- State what you need directly
- Frame requests as normal business processes
- Show confidence in your professional standing

*** Use Collaborative Framing

- "Let's get this sorted" vs. "I need you to tell me"
- "To make sure I get everything right" vs. "I need clarification"
- "This will help both of us" vs. "This will make my job easier"

*** Balance Formal and Casual Elements

Formal elements to retain:
- Clear subject lines
- Professional structure (sections, bullet points)
- Complete sentences and proper grammar
- Appropriate sign-offs

Casual elements to add:
- Conversational phrases ("sorted and sent over")
- Friendly openings ("Hope the event went well")
- Simple language over corporate jargon
- Shorter, more direct sentences

*** Be Direct About Problems

When identifying issues:
- State facts neutrally
- Avoid accusatory language
- Don't take blame for their oversights
- Make it clear what needs to be resolved

Example:
- Not: "I'm confused about the rates"
- But: "I've got two different rates in my emails"

** Structural Best Practices

*** Use Clear Sections

Organize complex requests into labeled sections:
- Makes it easy to respond
- Shows professional organization
- Reduces back-and-forth
- Demonstrates you've thought things through

*** Bullet Points for Multiple Items

When requesting multiple pieces of information:
- Use bullet points or numbered lists
- Keep each item concise
- Group related items together
- Make it easy to respond point-by-point

*** Set Appropriate Expectations

Include timelines or next steps:
- Shows you're organized
- Creates gentle pressure for response
- Demonstrates professionalism
- Avoids appearing desperate

Balance:
- Too demanding: "I need this within 24 hours"
- Too passive: "Whenever you get a chance"
- Better: "Once I hear back, I'll get the invoice sent over"

* Common Scenarios and Applications

** When Work Terms Weren't Established Upfront

If you've completed work without clear agreement on rates or terms:

1. Don't apologize for the lack of clarity
2. Present the facts of what was discussed
3. Request confirmation on specific points
4. Reference industry standards or past agreements
5. Set expectations for future work

** When There Are Rate Discrepancies

1. Present the discrepancy as factual observation
2. Provide documentation of both rates
3. Don't take a position on which is "right"
4. Request confirmation
5. Note that it "was not clearly established before commencement" (subtle acknowledgment that this is their oversight)

** When You Have Ongoing Relationships

Leverage future work appropriately:
- Mention it as context for establishing clear terms
- Frame it as mutual benefit
- Don't make it sound like a threat
- Use collaborative language
