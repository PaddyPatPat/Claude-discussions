* Overview

This document provides practical strategies for professional contractors and freelancers when communicating about invoices, payment terms, and billing clarification. It addresses the common challenge of completing work before all payment terms are clearly established, and how to navigate these situations professionally.

Special focus on international contracting (e.g., New Zealand contractors working for Australian clients) and managing ongoing client relationships.

* The Invoicing Challenge

** Common Scenario

You've completed work for a client but face unclear or conflicting information about:
- Hourly rates
- Billing increments (how time is rounded)
- What hours are billable (travel, setup, breaks)
- Minimum call periods
- Overtime calculations
- Expense reimbursements (per diems)

This situation often arises when:
- Working with a new client
- Terms weren't formalized before work began
- You received conflicting information from different people
- Standard practices weren't communicated upfront

** Why This Matters

Getting this right is critical for:
- Being paid fairly for work completed
- Establishing clear expectations for future engagements
- Maintaining professional credibility
- Setting boundaries in the client relationship
- Avoiding disputes or delayed payments

* Professional Positioning Strategies

** You're in a Stronger Position Than You Think

When work is completed, remember:
- You've delivered value
- They need to pay you
- You're requesting normal business information, not favors
- You have leverage (especially with ongoing work scheduled)

** Frame Requests Appropriately

Don't position yourself as:
- Confused or unsure
- Asking permission to be paid
- Apologetic for needing information
- Willing to accept whatever they offer

Instead, position yourself as:
- A professional requesting necessary business information
- Someone who ensures accurate billing
- Organized and detail-oriented
- Expecting fair compensation per industry standards

** The "Work Already Completed" Advantage

You've already demonstrated your value. Use this to:
- Request clarification confidently
- Reference industry standards
- Point to previous agreements
- Set expectations for future work

* Handling Rate Discrepancies

** Presenting the Discrepancy

When you've received conflicting rate information, present it as a factual observation requiring resolution.

*** Example: Effective Approach

#+BEGIN_SRC text
Rate Confirmation:
I've got two different rates in my emails. In December 2024, Brooke
confirmed $75 AUD/hour for similar work (see email excerpt below),
but your August email mentioned $70 AUD/hour. Please confirm which
rate applies, as this was not clearly established before commencement.
#+END_SRC

Key elements:
- States facts neutrally ("I've got two different rates")
- Provides specific documentation (dates, names, amounts)
- Requests confirmation (not permission)
- Notes this "was not clearly established before commencement" (subtle indication this is their oversight, not your confusion)

*** What NOT to Do

Don't say:
- "I'm confused about what rate to charge"
- "What rate do you want me to charge?"
- "I'm not sure which rate is right"
- "I'll charge whatever you think is fair"

These all position you as subordinate and uncertain rather than professional and organized.

** Documentation is Key

Always reference specific documentation:
- Previous emails with rates
- Contracts or agreements
- Similar work you've done for them
- Industry standard rates

Include relevant excerpts directly in your email to make it easy for them to review.

** International Rate Considerations

For international contracting (e.g., NZ contractor, Australian client):
- Be clear about currency (NZD vs. AUD)
- Consider exchange rates and their impact
- Understand tax implications on both sides
- Know standard rates in the client's market
- Reference any previous cross-border agreements

* Requesting Billing Parameter Clarification

** Essential Billing Parameters

When invoicing for hourly work, you need clarity on:

*** Travel Time Billing

- When does billing start for travel days?
  - When leaving home?
  - When arriving at airport?
  - When boarding the plane?
- When does billing end for return travel?
- Is travel billed at full rate or reduced rate?
- Are travel days subject to minimum call periods?

*** Work Day Definitions

- When does a work day start?
  - Leaving accommodation?
  - Arriving on site?
  - When work actually begins?
- When does it end?
  - Leaving site?
  - Arriving back at accommodation?
  - When work actually stops?

*** Breaks and Meals

- Are meal breaks billable or not?
- Length of meal breaks
- Are short breaks (coffee, bathroom) tracked separately?

*** Minimum Call Periods

- What's the minimum billable time for a work day?
- Does it vary by type of day (travel vs. work)?
- Are there different minimums for different day lengths?

Example from case study:
- 6-hour minimum for general work
- Travel days also 6-hour minimum
- Question: Are days over 5 hours automatically 10-hour minimums?

*** Overtime and Rounding

- When does overtime begin?
  - After 8 hours? 10 hours? 12 hours?
  - Or a different threshold?
- What's the overtime rate multiplier?
- How is time rounded?
  - 15-minute increments?
  - 30-minute increments?
  - Actual time to the minute?

*** Expenses and Per Diems

- Per diem rate for accommodation/meals
- When per diems apply (per night away? per day on site?)
- What expenses are separate vs. covered by per diem
- Receipt requirements

** How to Request This Information

*** Use Structured Format

Organize your questions clearly:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
Billing Parameters:
To complete the invoice, I need clarification on your standard billing
practices:

- Travel days: Billing commencement/completion points from Auckland
- Work days: Whether billing starts/ends at accommodation or on-site
- Meal breaks: Included or excluded from billable hours
- Minimum call periods: Whether non-travel days over 5 hours are
  billed as 10-hour minimums
- Overtime increments: 15 or 30-minute blocks
#+END_SRC

Benefits of this format:
- Easy to scan and respond to
- Shows you're organized
- Demonstrates you've thought through the details
- Makes it harder to ignore or defer
- Professional appearance

*** Reference Their Documentation

If they've mentioned any documentation:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
I'll use the roster from the SCA production manual as the base for
hours as you specified, once these parameters are confirmed.
#+END_SRC

This shows:
- You're listening and following their guidelines
- You're not making up your own rules
- You just need the missing pieces
- You're ready to invoice once parameters are clear

* Managing Ongoing Client Relationships

** Leverage Future Work Appropriately

If you have additional projects scheduled with this client, use it strategically.

*** Effective Approach

#+BEGIN_SRC text
Since we'll be working together on a few more projects over the coming
months, getting these details sorted now will make things much smoother
for both of us going forward.
#+END_SRC

What this accomplishes:
- Reminds them of ongoing relationship
- Frames clarity as mutual benefit
- Suggests this will prevent future issues
- Creates gentle pressure for clear response
- Collaborative rather than threatening tone

*** What to Avoid

Don't make it sound like a threat:
- "If we don't establish this, I won't work for you again"
- "I need this sorted or future projects are at risk"

Don't sound desperate:
- "I hope we can keep working together"
- "I'd really like to continue this relationship"

** Setting Expectations for Future Projects

Use the current invoicing process to establish norms:
- Clear terms before work begins
- Written confirmation of rates
- Understanding of all billing parameters
- Documentation of agreements

Follow-up strategy after this invoice is settled:
- Request written terms before next project
- Confirm rates and parameters in advance
- Reference the established practices from this discussion

** Building Professional Credibility

How you handle this situation affects future work:

Positive signals you're sending:
- Organized and detail-oriented
- Professional in approach
- Clear communicator
- Fair but firm on payment terms
- Easy to work with

Avoid sending these signals:
- Pushover who accepts any terms
- Disorganized or unprepared
- Confrontational or difficult
- Unprofessional in communication

* Email Structure for Invoice Clarification

** Complete Template

#+BEGIN_SRC text
Subject: Invoice Details Required - [Project Name]

Hi [Client Name],

Hope the [event/project] went well from your end too! I'm putting
together my invoice for the [specific work] and wanted to check a
few details with you to make sure I get everything right.

Rate Confirmation:
[Address any rate discrepancies clearly and factually, with specific
documentation references]

Billing Parameters:
To complete the invoice, I need clarification on your standard billing
practices:

- [Specific parameter 1]
- [Specific parameter 2]
- [Specific parameter 3]
- [etc.]

I'll use [any documentation they've referenced] as the base for
[relevant aspect], once these parameters are confirmed.

Since we'll be working together on [future projects], getting these
details sorted now will make things much smoother for both of us
going forward.

Once I hear back from you, I'll get the invoice sorted and sent over.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

** Subject Line Best Practices

Make it clear and actionable:
- Include what's needed: "Invoice Details Required"
- Include the project: "Ipswich V8 Supercars"
- Avoid vague subjects like "Question" or "Following up"

Good subject lines:
- "Invoice Details Required - [Project Name]"
- "Billing Parameters Confirmation - [Project Name]"
- "Rate Clarification Needed - [Project Name]"

** Opening Paragraph

Balance friendly and professional:
- Brief friendly greeting if appropriate
- State your purpose immediately
- Frame it positively ("to make sure I get everything right")
- Don't apologize or sound uncertain

** Body Organization

1. Rate confirmation (if needed) - address discrepancies first
2. Billing parameters - use bullet points
3. Reference to their documentation - shows you're following their process
4. Future work mention - creates gentle pressure and shows value
5. Clear next step - sets expectation for timeline

** Closing

Keep it simple and confident:
- Set expectation for your action after they respond
- Professional sign-off
- No apologies or deferent language

* International Contracting Considerations

** Currency Clarity

Always specify currency in all communications:
- "NZD" or "AUD" or "$75 AUD"
- Never assume which dollar sign means
- Confirm currency in rate discussions
- Consider exchange rate fluctuations for future work

** Tax and Payment Structures

Understand both jurisdictions:
- GST/VAT obligations
- Withholding tax requirements
- Invoice requirements in client's country
- Payment method considerations (international transfers, fees)

** Cultural Communication Differences

New Zealand ↔ Australia example:
- Generally similar business cultures
- Both value directness but with politeness
- "Mate" culture can blur professional boundaries
- Don't let casual culture make you accept poor terms

** Time Zone Considerations

- Be clear about time zones for deadlines
- Consider their business hours for follow-ups
- Build in reasonable response time

* Case Study: NZ Contractor, Australian Client

** Scenario Details

Contractor: Based in Auckland, New Zealand
Client: Australian production company
Work: Communications technician for V8 Supercars event in Ipswich, Australia
Issue: Completed work before all billing terms were established

** Complicating Factors

1. Multiple contacts with different rate information:
   - Brooke (December): $75 AUD/hour, 6-hour minimums, $75 AUD/night per diems
   - Nikki (August): $70 AUD/hour, same per diems

2. Lack of clarity on billing parameters:
   - Travel day billing points (international travel from Auckland)
   - Work day definitions
   - Meal break treatment
   - Minimum call periods
   - Overtime rounding

3. Ongoing relationship:
   - Several more weeks of work scheduled for coming months
   - Need to establish clear terms going forward

** Solution Strategy

1. Address rate discrepancy directly but neutrally
2. Request all billing parameters systematically
3. Reference their documentation (production manual)
4. Mention future work as reason to establish clarity
5. Maintain professional but collaborative tone

** Outcome Goals

Immediate:
- Get clear answers on all billing parameters
- Establish which rate applies
- Submit accurate invoice

Long-term:
- Set precedent for clear terms before future work
- Maintain positive working relationship
- Position as professional, organized contractor
- Ensure fair compensation on all future projects

* Common Mistakes to Avoid

** Mistake 1: Asking for Permission

Don't say:
- "What rate do you want me to charge?"
- "Is it okay if I bill for travel time?"
- "Would it be alright to include meal breaks?"

You're asking for information about their policies, not permission to be paid.

** Mistake 2: Accepting Blame

Don't say:
- "I should have clarified this before starting"
- "It's my fault for not asking"
- "I'm sorry I didn't get this sorted earlier"

The lack of clear terms is a shared responsibility, and you've completed good work.

** Mistake 3: Being Vague

Don't:
- Ask general questions
- Leave room for interpretation
- Accept "we'll figure it out"

Be specific about every parameter you need confirmed.

** Mistake 4: No Timeline

Don't:
- Leave the request open-ended
- Say "whenever you get a chance"
- Fail to indicate when you'll invoice

Set reasonable expectations for next steps.

** Mistake 5: Over-explaining

Don't:
- Apologize extensively
- Explain why you didn't ask before
- Make excuses
- Write paragraphs of context

Keep it professional, direct, and concise.

* Follow-up Strategies

** If You Don't Receive a Response

Wait a reasonable time (3-5 business days for non-urgent), then:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
Hi [Client Name],

Just following up on my email from [date] about the invoice details
for [project]. I'd like to get the invoice submitted this week - could
you confirm the billing parameters when you have a moment?

Thanks,
[Your Name]
#+END_SRC

** If You Receive a Partial Response

If they answer some questions but not all:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
Hi [Client Name],

Thanks for confirming [what they confirmed]. Just to make sure I have
everything, I still need clarification on:

- [Unanswered item 1]
- [Unanswered item 2]

Once I have these last details, I'll get the invoice finalized.

Cheers,
[Your Name]
#+END_SRC

** If They Push Back on Rates

If they question a rate you're requesting:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
Hi [Client Name],

The $75 AUD/hour rate was confirmed by Brooke in writing on [date]
for the Adelaide Tennis project (email copied below). I understood
this would be the standard rate for similar work. If there's been a
change in your rate structure, could we discuss that separately from
this invoice, which should be based on the rate we agreed to at the
time?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
#+END_SRC
