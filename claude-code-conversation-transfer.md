# Transferring Conversations Between Claude Interfaces

## Claude Web App to Claude Code

Unfortunately, there isn't a direct way to export or transfer existing Claude web app conversations to Claude Code. These are separate interfaces that don't share conversation history.

Claude Code is designed as a command-line tool for agentic coding tasks that starts fresh each time you use it - it doesn't have a built-in mechanism to import previous chat histories from the web interface.

## Available Options

1. **Start fresh in Claude Code** - Begin new conversations for your coding tasks

2. **Manual copy-paste** - If you have specific context or code from web chats that's relevant to your work, you could copy and paste that information into a new Claude Code session

3. **Use both interfaces** - Continue using the web app for general conversations and Claude Code specifically for coding tasks

## More Information
