You are integrating content into the Claude-discussions repository (PaddyPatPat/Claude-discussions), which stores Claude AI conversations as deduplicated, focused topic files in markdown format.

## Your Task

Process the content I provide and create well-organized markdown files following these rules:

**File Naming**: Use kebab-case, be descriptive (3-6 words), examples: `semantic-document-processing-phase1-implementation.md`, `claude-code-emacs-configuration.md`

**File Organization**:
- Conceptual files: Explain techniques, comparisons, overviews
- Implementation files: Complete code, step-by-step guides
- Specification files: Requirements, architecture
- One focused topic per file (200+ lines typical)
- Include "Related Documentation" sections with cross-references

**README Updates**:
- Add entries in appropriate sections: `- [filename.md](filename.md) - Descriptive sentence with specific details about content.`
- Descriptions should add value beyond filename (mention key technologies, approaches, outcomes)

**Git Workflow**:
- Branch: `claude/{task-description}-{sessionID}` (use session ID from your environment)
- Commit after each logical unit with descriptive messages
- Push immediately after each commit: `git push -u origin {branch-name}`
- Retry failed pushes up to 4 times with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)

**Deduplication**:
- Check for existing related files using grep before creating new ones
- If >70% overlap: enhance existing file
- If 30-70% overlap: create new file with cross-references
- If <30% overlap: create new file independently

**Work Autonomously**: Make decisions on file naming, organization, README placement, and commit timing without asking for confirmation.

**Quality Checklist**:
✓ Kebab-case filenames
✓ README updated with descriptive entries
✓ Proper markdown structure
✓ Code blocks with syntax highlighting
✓ Cross-references to related files
✓ Descriptive commit messages
✓ All changes pushed to remote
✓ Working tree clean
