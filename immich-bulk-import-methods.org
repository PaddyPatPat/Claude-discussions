* Overview

When importing hundreds of gigabytes of photos into Immich from a Mac computer, there are several methods available, each with different trade-offs for speed, reliability, and ease of use. This document covers all major import approaches and provides guidance on choosing the right method for your situation.

* Import Methods Comparison

** Immich CLI (Recommended for Large Imports)

The Immich CLI tool is specifically designed for bulk imports and offers the best combination of reliability and features for large photo libraries.

*** Advantages
- Designed specifically for bulk imports
- Resumes interrupted uploads automatically
- Handles duplicate detection
- Shows progress bars during transfer
- Can skip already imported files
- Supports concurrent uploads for faster transfer
- Most reliable for multi-hundred GB transfers

*** When to Use
- First-time bulk imports of large photo libraries
- When you need reliable resume capability
- When importing from a remote location
- When network reliability is a concern

** Web Interface Upload

The web interface provides a drag-and-drop upload feature suitable for smaller batches.

*** Advantages
- Simple graphical interface
- No additional software installation required
- Drag and drop entire folders
- Good for ad-hoc uploads

*** Limitations
- May timeout with very large uploads
- Less reliable for hundreds of gigabytes
- No automatic resume on failure
- Slower than CLI or direct transfer methods

*** When to Use
- Small to medium photo collections (< 50 GB)
- One-time uploads of specific albums
- When CLI installation is not possible
- For users uncomfortable with command-line tools

** Direct Server Access (Fastest)

Copy files directly to the Immich server's storage location and trigger a library scan.

*** Advantages
- Bypasses network transfer entirely (if physically connected)
- Fastest method when server is locally accessible
- No upload time over network
- Good for initial migration from local storage

*** Requirements
- Physical or network access to the server filesystem
- Knowledge of the server's upload location
- Proper file permissions configuration
- Ability to trigger library scan

*** When to Use
- Server is on the same local network
- You have SSH or file sharing access to the server
- Initial migration from existing storage
- Network bandwidth is limited

** External Libraries (Alternative Approach)

Set up an external library that points to a network-mounted folder, avoiding file copying entirely.

*** Advantages
- No file duplication
- Preserves original folder structure
- Files remain in their original location
- Can access same files from multiple systems
- No storage space duplication

*** Limitations
- Requires network mount configuration
- Server must have continuous access to the mounted location
- Network reliability affects access
- May have slower access times than local storage

*** When to Use
- Storage space is limited
- Want to maintain original folder organization
- Multiple systems need access to the same files
- Photos are already on network-attached storage (NAS)

* Decision Matrix

| Method | Speed | Reliability | Ease of Use | Best For |
|--------+-------+-------------+-------------+----------|
| CLI | Medium | Excellent | Medium | Large bulk imports |
| Web Interface | Slow | Good | Excellent | Small uploads |
| Direct Server | Fastest | Good | Hard | Local migrations |
| External Library | N/A | Medium | Hard | No duplication |

* General Tips for Large Imports

** Preparation
- Organize photos into logical folders before importing
- Verify Immich server has sufficient storage space
- Test with a small subset first
- Document your import approach for future reference

** Network Considerations
- Large uploads work best on reliable, fast connections
- Consider time-of-day for network bandwidth availability
- Wired connections are more reliable than WiFi
- Monitor transfer speeds and adjust concurrency

** Batch Processing
- Consider importing in smaller batches (e.g., by year or event)
- Makes the process more manageable
- Easier to verify successful imports
- Can pause between batches if needed

** Monitoring
- Check available storage space during import
- Monitor server performance
- Verify imports are completing successfully
- Keep track of what has been imported
