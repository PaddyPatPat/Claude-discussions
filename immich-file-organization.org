* Overview

Immich handles file organization differently than traditional folder-based photo management systems. Understanding how Immich organizes files versus how it presents them to users is crucial for deciding on an import strategy.

* Immich's Organization Philosophy

** Database-Driven vs Folder-Based

Immich uses a database-centric approach rather than relying on folder structures:

- *Traditional approach*: Folders represent organization (e.g., =Photos/2023/Vacation/=)
- *Immich approach*: Database stores metadata; files organized by date/user
- *User view*: Albums, tags, and metadata provide organization
- *File system*: Optimized storage structure independent of user organization

* How Immich Organizes Files on Disk

** Automatic Reorganization

When you upload files to Immich (via CLI, web interface, or direct copy + scan):

1. Immich reads EXIF metadata (date taken, camera, location, etc.)
2. Files are moved/copied into Immich's internal structure
3. Original folder names are *not* preserved in file system
4. Organization happens in the database, not folders

** Internal Folder Structure

Immich typically organizes files like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
/library/
├── [user-id]/
│   ├── 2023/
│   │   ├── 2023-01/
│   │   │   ├── IMG_1234.jpg
│   │   │   ├── IMG_1235.jpg
│   │   ├── 2023-02/
│   │   │   ├── IMG_1236.jpg
│   ├── 2024/
│   │   ├── 2024-01/
│   │   │   ├── IMG_2001.jpg
#+END_SRC

Organization based on:
- *Date taken* (from EXIF data)
- *User ID*
- *Year/Month structure*

** What Gets Lost

When using standard import methods:

- ❌ Original folder names
- ❌ Folder hierarchy
- ❌ Custom organization structure
- ✓ EXIF metadata (date, camera, location)
- ✓ File names
- ✓ Image content
- ⚠️ Folder names *may* become album names (depends on import method)

* How to Preserve Your Organization

** Option 1: Use Albums

Immich's album feature provides logical organization:

*** Albums from Folders (CLI Upload)

The CLI can convert folder structure to albums:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
immich upload Photos/Vacation --album "Summer Vacation 2023"
#+END_SRC

During import, folder names may automatically become album names (behavior varies by version).

*** Manual Album Creation

After import:
1. Select photos in Immich web interface
2. Click "Add to Album"
3. Create album with descriptive name
4. Organize photos into logical collections

*** Album Features

- Multiple photos can be in multiple albums
- Albums can be shared
- Albums can have descriptions
- Albums are independent of file storage location

** Option 2: Use External Libraries (Preserves Structure)

*This is the solution if preserving folder structure is critical.*

External libraries allow Immich to index photos without moving them:

- Files stay in original location
- Original folder structure preserved
- Immich indexes and displays them
- No file duplication
- See [[file:immich-external-libraries.org][External Libraries Configuration]]

** Option 3: Use Tags and Metadata

Immich supports rich metadata:

- Tags (manual or automatic)
- People recognition
- Object/scene detection
- Location data
- Date-based organization
- Search by metadata

* Import Methods and Organization Impact

** Immich CLI Upload

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
immich upload /path/to/photos --recursive
#+END_SRC

*Result*:
- Files reorganized by date
- Original folder structure lost
- May create albums from folder names
- All metadata preserved

** Direct Server Copy + Library Scan

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cp -r /source/photos/* /immich/upload/location/
# Then trigger library scan in web interface
#+END_SRC

*Result*:
- Same as CLI upload
- Immich still reorganizes files
- Original structure lost
- Metadata preserved

** External Library Mount

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
# Mount external location
- /nas/photos:/external/photos
#+END_SRC

*Result*:
- ✓ Original structure preserved
- ✓ No file duplication
- ✓ Files stay in place
- ⚠️ Requires permanent network access

* Folder Structure Examples

** Before Import (Your Organization)

#+BEGIN_SRC
Photos/
├── 2023/
│   ├── Vacation-Summer/
│   │   ├── Day1/
│   │   ├── Day2/
│   ├── Family-Events/
│   │   ├── Birthday/
│   │   ├── Wedding/
├── 2024/
│   ├── Work/
│   ├── Personal/
#+END_SRC

** After CLI/Web Upload (Immich's Organization)

#+BEGIN_SRC
/library/user-abc123/
├── 2023/
│   ├── 2023-06/  # All June photos together
│   │   ├── IMG_001.jpg  # From Vacation Day1
│   │   ├── IMG_002.jpg  # From Vacation Day1
│   │   ├── IMG_015.jpg  # From Vacation Day2
│   ├── 2023-07/
│   │   ├── IMG_050.jpg  # From Birthday
│   │   ├── IMG_051.jpg  # From Wedding
├── 2024/
│   ├── 2024-01/
│   │   ├── IMG_100.jpg  # Work photos
│   │   ├── IMG_101.jpg  # Personal photos
#+END_SRC

*Organized by date taken, not original folders*

** With External Library (Preserved Structure)

#+BEGIN_SRC
/external/photos/  # Original location, unchanged
├── 2023/
│   ├── Vacation-Summer/
│   │   ├── Day1/
│   │   ├── Day2/
│   ├── Family-Events/
│   │   ├── Birthday/
│   │   ├── Wedding/
#+END_SRC

*Immich indexes but doesn't move files*

* Recreating Organization in Immich

** Strategy 1: Album-Based

1. Import all photos (they get reorganized by date)
2. Use search/filters to find related photos
3. Create albums for events/topics
4. Organize photos into albums

Example:
- Album: "Summer Vacation 2023"
- Album: "Sarah's Birthday"
- Album: "Work Conference 2024"

** Strategy 2: Tag-Based

1. Import photos
2. Tag photos with relevant keywords
3. Use tag search to find collections
4. Combine with date filters

Example tags:
- vacation, summer, beach
- family, birthday
- work, conference

** Strategy 3: Hybrid (Albums + Tags + Search)

Combine multiple organization methods:
- Albums for major events
- Tags for themes/subjects
- Date filters for time-based browsing
- Location search for place-based organization
- People recognition for person-based organization

* Best Practices

** Before Import

1. *Decide on organization strategy*:
   - Standard import + recreate with albums?
   - External library to preserve structure?
   - Hybrid approach?

2. *Clean up source folders*:
   - Remove duplicates
   - Fix incorrect dates if possible
   - Organize logically if using external libraries

3. *Document your structure*:
   - Note important folder organizations
   - Plan album structure
   - Identify tags to use

** During Import

1. *Test with small batch*:
   - Upload one folder
   - Check how it appears in Immich
   - Verify metadata preservation
   - Test organization features

2. *Consider batch imports by topic*:
   - Import vacation photos together
   - Create album immediately after import
   - Easier to organize than one giant import

** After Import

1. *Create albums promptly*:
   - Organize while still fresh in mind
   - Use search to find related photos
   - Take advantage of date/location filters

2. *Use automatic features*:
   - People recognition
   - Object detection
   - Location tagging

3. *Don't rely solely on filesystem*:
   - Think in terms of albums and searches
   - Leverage database capabilities
   - Use metadata to organize

* Decision Guide: Which Approach?

** Use Standard Import (CLI/Web) If:

- You want Immich to manage storage optimization
- You're comfortable with album-based organization
- You don't need to access files outside Immich
- You want to take full advantage of Immich features
- Storage space for duplication is not a concern

** Use External Libraries If:

- Preserving folder structure is critical
- Other applications need access to same files
- Storage space for duplication is limited
- You have existing workflows dependent on folder structure
- You want to maintain manual control over file organization

** Hybrid Approach:

- Main library in Immich (standard import)
- External library for archive/backup
- Active photos imported, archived photos as external
- Best of both worlds, more complex to manage

* Migrating Organization

** From Folder-Based to Album-Based

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Import each major folder separately and create album
immich upload ~/Photos/Vacation-2023 --album "Summer Vacation 2023"
immich upload ~/Photos/Birthday-2023 --album "Sarah's Birthday"
#+END_SRC

** From Standard to External Library

1. Set up external library pointing to original photos
2. Import original photos through external library
3. Remove duplicates from standard library
4. Update workflows to use external library structure
